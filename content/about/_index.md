## TL;DR 
I'm a happy nerd

## Q&A
### Who are you
An undergradute student at an ordinary university, who is pursuing an bachelor's degree in Information Teachnology. 

Here's a list of facts about me (*will be more in the future*):
- Just a freaky guy from Vietnam
- An shy person trying to be more social
- Love programming and music --- listening, playing, and writing

### Why this blog exist
This blog is a place where I can share my thoughts and learn English by writing.

### How I made this website
I built this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a home-made theme called *Cozy Garden* (I customized the [Hugo Bear Blog theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) and added my own features --- but in the end, it turn out to be a completely different theme ðŸ˜…). It's hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain. [The link to this website repository on Github](https://github.com/nhat-tien/blog).

### Why the website look so boring
Well...there are a few reasons why I didn't put much effort into designing this website. The main one is that I want to focus more on writing. The last time I made a blog, I spent way to much time trying to make the UI look perfect. But at the end of the day, I didn't write any posts. This time I'm trying not to make that mistake again.
