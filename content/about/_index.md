## FAQs
### Who are you?
I'm Le Dang Nhat Tien, an undergradute student at an ordinary university, who is pursuing an bachelor's degree in Information Technology. 

Here's a list of facts about me:
- Just a freaky guy from Vietnam
- A shy person trying to be more social
- Love programming (**I use Neovim btw**) and music --- listening, playing, and writing
- Dream of being a legendary programmer (but I'm still noob).

### Why does this blog exist?
This blog is a place where I can share my thoughts and learn English by writing.

### How do you make this blog?
I built this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a home-made theme called *Cozy Garden* (I customized the [Hugo Bear Blog theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) and added my own features, but in the end, it turn out to be a completely different theme ðŸ˜…). It's hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain. [The link to this website repository on Github](https://github.com/nhat-tien/blog).

If I have time in the future, I will make my own SSG for hobby project.

### Why the website look so boring?
Well...there are a few reasons why I didn't put much effort into designing this website. The main one is that I want to focus more on writing. The last time I made a blog, I spent way to much time trying to make the UI look perfect. But at the end of the day, I didn't write any posts. This time I'm trying not to make that mistake again.
