## This website
I built it with Hugo. The repo link [here](https://github.com/nhat-tien/blog)

## Q & A
### Why this blog exist
This blog is a place where I can share my thoughts, and learn English by writing.

### Why the website look so boring
Well...there are a few reasons why I didn't put much effort into designing this website. The main reason is that I want to focus more on writing. The last time I built a blog, I spent a lot of time designing the UI to make it look perfect. But at the end of the day, I didn't write any posts. This time I'm determined not to make that mistake again.
