## Just a bit of math 

### What is Odd?

Odds are used to describe the chance of an event occurring. The odds are the *ratios that compare the number of ways the event can occur with the number of ways the event cannot occurr*.

$$
   Odds = \frac{p}{1 - p}
$$

For example, if the probability of rain is 0.75 (or 75%), the probability of no rain is 0.25 (or 25%). The odds of rain are 0.75 / 0.25 = 3. This means it's three times more likely to rain than not to rain.

**Important:  Odds are not probabilities**

$$
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
