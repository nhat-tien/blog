> This is the first post in series `my thoughts`, I want to write down my thoughts about anything in life.

Today is just a day as usual. I have some thing to work on it, but I have some feeling. I always busy with the project, but the outcome not much as I expected, it make me wonder about the path I'm following. Will I get better in the future? Will I achieve the happy life. I don't know.

Sometimes, I feel a little bit of jealous when I see other gain something I does't have.
