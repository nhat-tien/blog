Today is just a day as usual. I have some thing to work on it, but I have some feeling. I always busy with the project, but the outcome not much as I expected, it make me wonder about the path I'm following. Will I get better in the future? Will I achieve the happy life. I don't know.

Sometimes, I feel a little bit of jealous when I see other gain something I does't have. 

## I, programming, and part-time depression

- Though I try very hard, I really not sastify with that
- I learn very much, but still just a tiny when compare to other

I wonder how I describe my situation now. I lose the motivation or it just procastinate.

The reality come up, I so weak to deal with 

The solution is, now I have to list all the character I wish myself be, and no more compare with other people

## The fear of being wasted
## q

I quit social media
