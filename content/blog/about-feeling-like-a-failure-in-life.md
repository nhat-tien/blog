Today is just a day as usual. I have some thing to work on it,but
I have some feeling. I always busy with the project, but the outcome not much
as I expected, it make me wonder about the path I'm following. Will I get
better in the future? Will I achieve the happy life. I don't know.

Sometimes, I feel a little bit of jealous when I see other gain something I does't have. 
Though I try very hard, I really not sastify with that. 
I learn very much, but still just a tiny when compare to other
I wonder how I describe my situation now. I lose the motivation or it just procastinate.
The reality come up, I so weak to deal with 

just accept the fact that I'm not smart, I still lack of experience, does not
say "Why I am a failure?", just say "I am a failure, so what to
do next?". Once we free from the negative feeling, everything now clear as a blue
sky after a storm.

When you think about you lose compare to someone, I remind you if you see
there is no one is better than you, you currently doing wrong in your life.
